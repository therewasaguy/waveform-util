Waveform.coffee - some basic utiltiy functions for working with audio files 
and waveform data. At the moment, this module has functions for extracting
peak data from audio files (in the form of peak arrays, useful)
###

pcm = require 'pcm'; ffprobe = require 'node-ffprobe'
fs = require 'fs'; path = require 'path'

###
Generates a peaks object from a given audio file in the format:
{
  peaks: [Number,...]
  max_peak: Number
}
This is useful when dynamically drawing waveforms, for example, in a HTML
canvas object. The peaks are unitless, and should be scaled to the height of
the element into which you're drawing them. Max_peak is helpful for this.

You should get a peaks array with approximately as many entries as your 
specified output_width (there may be slightly fewer, or fewer if the file is
very short). The idea here is that you draw a waveform by drawing a 1px wide
line for each peak in the array.

###
Extracts useful audio data from a given path to an audio file, handy when
doing conversion or drawing waveforms. We provide this a separate function
since you'll probably want to save some processing time by doing this once
for each audio file and storing the output (whereas generate waveform may
be called lots of times to render the waveform at different widths/zoom levels
).

  ffprobe audio_path, (err, probeData) ->
    return cb err if err
    if not probeData.streams? or probeData.streams.length < 1
      return cb new Error "File didn't contain any valid audio streams."
